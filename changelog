SASI v1.2.0 to 1.2.1 changes

	DRV5055A3QLPGM -> DRV5055A3QDBZR	

	A3/Z3: 25 mV/mT, Â±85-mT Range

	DRV5055	A3		Q		LPG		M
		25mV/mT		Non-Auto	TO-92		3000 per package
				E		DBZ		R
				Automotive/Q-1	SOT-23		3000 per package
			  
Solidified selection of DRV5055A3 hall effect sensor					v1.2.1
	A1 saturated too quickly and A2 was less centered than A3
Rotated DRV5055A3 footprint by 180 degrees						v1.2.1
	keeps consistency with magnet polarity of previous versions
Move "SASI vX.X" to top to be visible with parts on					v1.2.1
Alter "Sharp Analog Snap In" to be visible with parts on				v1.2.1

Cleared footprint within TLC in anticipation for SASI v2.0				v1.2.1	
Move all resistors to the bottom surface						v1.2.0
Input Resistors now Under Arrows							v1.2.0
Slightly Moved "SHARP DESIGNS" down		


Designed holes in SASI bottom plate for SMD components					v1.2.0
	4mm round, 5mm for DRV
Designed holes in SASI bottom plate for THT components					v1.2.0
	10mm for JST-PH, 7mm for Pots
Return to no chamfer on arms								v1.2.0	
	large chamfer radius allows for tilting with the THT SASI
Return to no chamfer on hat by arms							v1.2.0
	reduces arm wiggle at ends of movement	
Reduce guide height tolerance (currently 1mm)						v1.2.0
	reduces vertical wiggle when switching direction
Extend Hall Effect Side of Hat Guide							v1.2.0
	longer movement in hat
Reduce SASI arm magnet width tolerance from 0.4mm to 0.15mm				v1.2.0		
Set wider octagon gate as standard (20.5mm as opposed to 19 mm)				v1.2.0
