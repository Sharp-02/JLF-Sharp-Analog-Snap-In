SASI v1.1.0 to 1.2.0 changes

Overview:
Design changes to shift to SMD soldering techniques over pen soldering
Increase machinability to allow for machined slider arms

Hall effect sensor replaced
Now uses SMD Hall effect sensors below the SASI mod
	TO-92 -> SOT23				8 Sept 2023:
	DRV5055A3QLPGM -> DRV5055A1QDBZR	
			  DRV5055A2EDBZRQ1	
			  DRV5055A3QDBZR	
	
	A1/Z1: 100 mV/mT, ±21-mT Range
	A2/Z2: 50 mV/mT, ±42-mT Range
	A3/Z3: 25 mV/mT, ±85-mT Range

	DRV5055	A3		Q		LPG		M

Move all resistors to the bottom surface						
Input Resistors now Under Arrows							
Slightly Moved "SHARP DESIGNS" down							

Designed holes in SASI bottom plate for SMD components					
	4mm round, 5mm for DRV
Designed holes in SASI bottom plate for THT components					
	10mm for JST-PH, 7mm for Pots
Return to no chamfer on arms								
	large chamfer radius allows for tilting with the THT SASI
Return to no chamfer on hat by arms
	reduces arm wiggle at ends of movement	
Reduce guide height tolerance (currently 1mm)
	reduces vertical wiggle when switching direction
Extend Hall Effect Side of Hat Guide
	longer movement in hat
Reduce SASI arm magnet width tolerance from 0.4mm to 0.15mm				
Set wider octagon gate as standard (20.5mm as opposed to 19 mm)
