SASI v1.2 to 1.3 changes

Overview:
Redimension and remodel SASI to update easier and be more robust
	Redimension also will allow to transfer from Autodesk Inventor to F360 or Solidworks easier
	Current implementation has too many dependencies on previous features and breaks too easily when changed
Introduce deeper naming convention for SASI changes
	X.X -> X.X.Xa/bX
Introduce variable parameters for machinability and injection molding
Introduce variable parameters for fitment and sliding tolerances
Create drawings and better defined positions for PCB and components
	Allows for transfer to programs such as Altium or KiCad
